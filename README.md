# IWLS_pygeoapi

pygeoapi plugins to access and process water level and surface currents from the CHS Integrated Water Level System (IWLS) public API

Currently include a pygeoapi data provider plugin to interface with the IWLS database (https://api-iwls.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/v3/api-docs/swagger-config) and a S-100 process plugin to convert observed, predicted and quality control forecasts water levels data to S-104 DCF8 format and HADCP surface currents to S-111 DCF8 format.
